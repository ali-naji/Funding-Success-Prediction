    <p>
      Our Algorithm is a classification model that takes in information about
      your prospected project like its description, estimated number of backers,
      financial goal, and whether you will enable or disable communication with
      backers to a classifier that is trained on thousands of project funding
      successes and failures with high prediction accuracy to predict the
      full-funding success chances of your project. Note that success here means
      fully-meeting financial goals within deadline of project. Projects
      partially funded by assigned deadline are failures
